As matters stand, these basic conditions are not being met.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:20:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How China Achieved Innovation Without Freedom</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/smart-authoritarianism-enabled-china-to-become-an-innovation-leader-by-jennifer-lind-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/smart-authoritarianism-enabled-china-to-become-an-innovation-leader-by-jennifer-lind-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Though China remains a one-party state that disappears dissidents and censors ideas, it has vaulted past Japan, Germany, and France to become the world’s tenth most-innovative economy. It owes this achievement – which was long considered impossible – to a pioneering strategy of "smart authoritarianism."&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:17:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine Loses Again</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-28-point-ukraine-peace-plan-and-zelensky-corruption-scandal-will-hurt-ukrainians-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-28-point-ukraine-peace-plan-and-zelensky-corruption-scandal-will-hurt-ukrainians-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Amid a corruption scandal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may well be able to convince EU leaders to remain focused on the “real enemy”: Russia. But further revelations will weaken his position in negotiations with a US administration eager for a foreign-policy victory, leaving ordinary Ukrainians to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:31:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can Modi Turn India into a Developed Economy by 2047?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-developed-country-status-effort-faces-significant-headwinds-by-anne-o-krueger-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-developed-country-status-effort-faces-significant-headwinds-by-anne-o-krueger-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Achieving Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious goal will require far more than accelerating economic growth.

Canada can begin to reduce its overreliance on the United States, Sweden can increase its influence and market share, and NATO will get a stronger northern flank that is less exposed to swings in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:31:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Holiday 2025 Reading List</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/holiday-2025-reading-list</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/holiday-2025-reading-list</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the &lt;/em&gt;PS &lt;em&gt;Book Recommendations &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/newsletters" title="Sign up for the newsletter."&gt;&lt;em&gt;newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; – available for free to all registered &lt;/em&gt;Project Syndicate&lt;em&gt; users – we highlight insightful, informative, or otherwise compelling books, written or recommended by PS contributors.

Not only is Trump's MAGA movement unapologetically nationalist, but it is eager to make common cause with Europeans who share its chauvinist view of politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 15:29:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Ukraine Deserves to Survive</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-corruption-investigation-exposes-putins-worst-fear-by-anna-husarska-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-corruption-investigation-exposes-putins-worst-fear-by-anna-husarska-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With a new US-Russia peace plan proposing what amounts to Ukraine's capitulation to its aggressor, a corruption investigation focusing on President Volodymyr Zelensky's inner circle would seem to be the last thing the country needs.
