Lithuania's plans for a new training ground near the Suwałki corridor are thus a test case for assessing US and European resolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 12:07:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>India’s Government Must Defend Taxpayers, Not Foreign Investors</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/indian-supreme-court-landmark-ruling-bolsters-case-for-tax-sovereignty-by-jayati-ghosh-and-diego-lluma-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/indian-supreme-court-landmark-ruling-bolsters-case-for-tax-sovereignty-by-jayati-ghosh-and-diego-lluma-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Foreign companies have reaped enormous profits from India’s fast-growing digital economy while paying little or no tax by channeling investments through offshore entities.

Reducing dependence on China is not as simple as switching a few suppliers; it demands the cultivation of comparable industrial density, including supplier networks, skills, tooling, and patient finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:43:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Trade Truce Won’t Restore the US-India Relationship</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trade-truce-will-not-restore-us-india-relationship-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trade-truce-will-not-restore-us-india-relationship-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of an interim trade deal between the US and India, hopes are high that the bruising confrontation initiated by President Donald Trump last year is coming to an end.
