But the European Union urgently needs reforms to unlock these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 10:12:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will 2026 Bring Financial Crisis?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/will-2026-bring-financial-crisis</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/will-2026-bring-financial-crisis</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From US President Donald Trump’s weaponization of trade to the erosion of US Treasuries’ status as safe-haven assets and breakneck investment in AI, the last year has shaken the foundations of the postwar global economy. As 2025 comes to an end, we asked &lt;em&gt;PS &lt;/em&gt;commentators whether a crisis is imminent, and how economies can mitigate the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 10:05:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Outlook for the US Economy in 2026</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-economy-outlook-2026-by-nouriel-roubini-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-economy-outlook-2026-by-nouriel-roubini-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Although there was a massive boom in AI-related investments in 2025, policy-induced uncertainties and disruptions to official data releases clouded the picture.

But further revelations will weaken his position in negotiations with a US administration eager for a foreign-policy victory, leaving ordinary Ukrainians to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:31:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can Modi Turn India into a Developed Economy by 2047?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-developed-country-status-effort-faces-significant-headwinds-by-anne-o-krueger-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-developed-country-status-effort-faces-significant-headwinds-by-anne-o-krueger-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Achieving Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious goal will require far more than accelerating economic growth.

Canada can begin to reduce its overreliance on the United States, Sweden can increase its influence and market share, and NATO will get a stronger northern flank that is less exposed to swings in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:31:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Holiday 2025 Reading List</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/holiday-2025-reading-list</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/holiday-2025-reading-list</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the &lt;/em&gt;PS &lt;em&gt;Book Recommendations &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/newsletters" title="Sign up for the newsletter."&gt;&lt;em&gt;newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; – available for free to all registered &lt;/em&gt;Project Syndicate&lt;em&gt; users – we highlight insightful, informative, or otherwise compelling books, written or recommended by PS contributors.
