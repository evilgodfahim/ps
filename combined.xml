That belief has not aged well, and a new policy approach must include innovation, good jobs, climate stability, gender equality, and a state empowered to provide effective regulation and high-quality public services.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe Must Close the Space Gap</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-space-gap-ceding-markets-power-to-us-china-and-others-by-anders-fogh-rasmussen-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-space-gap-ceding-markets-power-to-us-china-and-others-by-anders-fogh-rasmussen-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine showed Europeans that they cannot take their security for granted or rely on others for critical functions.
