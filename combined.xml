Yet instead of doubling down, its leaders are weakening the social and economic model that made that achievement possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:14:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Last Days of Fed Independence?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-costs-of-trump-efforts-to-politicize-monetary-policy-by-anne-o-krueger-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-costs-of-trump-efforts-to-politicize-monetary-policy-by-anne-o-krueger-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump is again ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve, this time with a criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. If Trump appoints a pliant successor, monetary policy will likely be looser than warranted, stoking inflation and undermining global economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:55:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The EU-Mercosur Deal Puts Principles into Practice</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-mercosur-agreement-why-it-matters-by-carlos-cuerpo-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-mercosur-agreement-why-it-matters-by-carlos-cuerpo-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By pushing through a long-awaited trade agreement with Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay), Europeans have demonstrated that they can manage their political differences and overcome resistance within and outside their borders.

Cracking down too hard could undo the entente that the regime forged with the population after last year's 12-day war with Israel and the United States, but letting them grow could itself invite foreign intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 19:19:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Slain Mother and the Triumph of the Lie</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-officials-lying-about-renee-nicole-good-confers-maga-membership-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-officials-lying-about-renee-nicole-good-confers-maga-membership-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis mother by federal officials was certainly a tragedy and almost certainly a crime.
