The absence of reliable statistics, lagging innovation, and worsening air quality all point to institutional decay that only sustained, coordinated national action can reverse.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:07:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Financing the Global South’s Infrastructure Boom</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/financing-global-south-infrastructure-boom-by-rakesh-mohan-and-divya-srinivasan-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/financing-global-south-infrastructure-boom-by-rakesh-mohan-and-divya-srinivasan-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across the Global South, one of the biggest challenges is not just to build more infrastructure, but to build it right. Without institutional capacity and financial depth, the increasingly popular public-private-partnership model can backfire, creating a vicious spiral of debt, delays, and disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:12:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand’s Royalist Right Turn</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-did-conservative-royalists-win-thailand-election-by-thitinan-pongsudhirak-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-did-conservative-royalists-win-thailand-election-by-thitinan-pongsudhirak-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With a rock-solid parliamentary majority, as well as the backing of the military and judiciary, the royalist-conservative Bhumjaithai Party is poised to spend its full four-year term governing in the service of establishment interests.
