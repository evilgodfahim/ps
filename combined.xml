Cracking down too hard could undo the entente that the regime forged with the population after last year's 12-day war with Israel and the United States, but letting them grow could itself invite foreign intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 19:19:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Slain Mother and the Triumph of the Lie</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-officials-lying-about-renee-nicole-good-confers-maga-membership-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-officials-lying-about-renee-nicole-good-confers-maga-membership-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis mother by federal officials was certainly a tragedy and almost certainly a crime.
