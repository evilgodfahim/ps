Policymakers must start viewing agriculture as a strategic sector that not only sustains households, but also anchors fragile states, gives legitimacy to governments, and creates an opening for cooperation in an increasingly fragmented world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 16:26:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Africa’s Financial Sovereignty Is Under Attack</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/challenging-afreximbank-preferred-creditor-status-undermines-africa-financial-sovereignty-by-carlos-lopes-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/challenging-afreximbank-preferred-creditor-status-undermines-africa-financial-sovereignty-by-carlos-lopes-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Critics and credit-rating agencies have been challenging the legitimacy of Afreximbank’s preferred creditor status.
