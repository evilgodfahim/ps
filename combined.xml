Whether Russian leaders realize it or not, they have no path to victory.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:40:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Problem with America’s Health-Care Subsidies</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-health-care-subsidies-should-be-allowed-to-expire-by-michael-r-strain-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-health-care-subsidies-should-be-allowed-to-expire-by-michael-r-strain-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The US federal government shutdown has become a standoff over health care that will likely end with some sort of extension of the temporary health-insurance subsidies adopted during the pandemic. But that would not address the larger problem of America’s high health-care costs – to say nothing of its fiscal imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:55:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Electricity Will Decide the AI Race</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By advancing open AI models and investing in renewable-energy capacity, China is creating an energy-compute flywheel: more clean power enables more compute, which in turn optimizes the grid. This puts China at a distinct advantage vis-à-vis the West, where energy constraints are creating digital bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:41:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Harnessing AI Without Undermining Democracy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-promises-and-perils-for-democracy-by-kelly-born-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-promises-and-perils-for-democracy-by-kelly-born-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From deepfakes and black-box algorithms to new tools to improve government effectiveness and civic engagement, AI is already reshaping democracies. To meet this moment, we must help democracies adopt AI while ensuring governments establish essential guardrails to protect rights, privacy, agency, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 09:51:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>In Defense of Encryption</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/protecting-encryption-means-no-backdoors-for-law-enforcement-eu-chat-control-by-sally-wentworth-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/protecting-encryption-means-no-backdoors-for-law-enforcement-eu-chat-control-by-sally-wentworth-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s proposed Child Sexual Abuse Regulation creates a dangerous illusion of safety that does little to protect children. Worse, by compromising the confidentiality and privacy provided by end-to-end encryption, the EU's approach creates new vulnerabilities that could put users everywhere at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:20:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What Really Works Against Youth Crime?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/harsh-sentences-for-young-people-do-not-deter-crime-but-predictable-punishments-do-by-jennifer-doleac-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/harsh-sentences-for-young-people-do-not-deter-crime-but-predictable-punishments-do-by-jennifer-doleac-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that, when it comes to deterring crime, the severity of punishment – the length of a prison sentence – matters far less than whether punishment is swift and certain. This finding holds true for adults, but the difference is especially stark for teenagers, given their higher impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:36:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is Economics Promoting Inequality?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-focus-on-self-interest-is-fueling-inequality-and-undermining-cooperation-by-kaushik-basu-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-focus-on-self-interest-is-fueling-inequality-and-undermining-cooperation-by-kaushik-basu-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mainstream economics has often underestimated the critical role of trust and cooperation in enabling prosperity. As a result, it has justified and even encouraged the greed, exploitation, and extreme inequality that are eroding political accountability, contributing to rising nationalism, and undermining human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:00:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Manifest Destiny</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reviving-us-imperialism-and-martial-ethos-will-end-badly-by-joe-jackson-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reviving-us-imperialism-and-martial-ethos-will-end-badly-by-joe-jackson-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump appears committed to extending America's imperialist legacy and channeling a martial ethos that can be traced back to the Spanish-American War of 1898, when the US "liberated" Cuba and the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule.

The fact that he is doubling down on unpopular policies only adds to the evidence that he does not intend to allow a free and fair congressional election in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:55:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will Stablecoins Preserve Dollar Dominance?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-stablecoins-save-dollar-global-primacy-by-barry-eichengreen-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-stablecoins-save-dollar-global-primacy-by-barry-eichengreen-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The dollar may be the dominant global currency for the moment, but there are real questions about how long this moment will last.
