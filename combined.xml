His intervention in Venezuela could be the point at which his governing style collides with reality, alienating his base and accelerating his political decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 09:22:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump Has Condemned Europe to Success</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-forcing-eu-to-become-superpower-militarily-economically-geopolitically-by-slawomir-sierakowski-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-forcing-eu-to-become-superpower-militarily-economically-geopolitically-by-slawomir-sierakowski-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To survive in a dangerous new world, the European Union, established as an antidote to power politics, must contradict the very principle on which it was founded by becoming a superpower in its own right.

But centuries of experience across dozens of countries suggest that the kind of heterodox experiment now underway in the US rarely ends well in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:15:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine Is Essential to Europe’s Post-American Defense</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-key-to-europes-defense-after-american-withdrawal-by-tatyana-deryugina-et-al-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-key-to-europes-defense-after-american-withdrawal-by-tatyana-deryugina-et-al-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Given the growing doubts about American security guarantees, Ukraine is now the first and by far most effective line of defense for Europe. It should therefore be recognized as a key element of Europe’s defense perimeter, with access to European funding, technology, networks, and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:44:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>America’s Year of Self-Destruction</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-american-self-destruction-by-joschka-fischer-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-american-self-destruction-by-joschka-fischer-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The United States owes its superpower status not to pure might, but to the unique combination of material advantages and Enlightenment values. With his reliance on naked power and rejection of all constraints on his authority, Donald Trump represents the opposite of everything that made the country great.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:58:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>American or Chinese Exceptionalism?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-threatens-american-exceptionalism-could-worsen-us-china-conflict-by-stephen-s-roach-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-threatens-american-exceptionalism-could-worsen-us-china-conflict-by-stephen-s-roach-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Both US and Chinese leaders are guilty of personalizing the conflict-prone Sino-American relationship. Continuing down this path – particularly if Donald Trump’s degradation of American leadership becomes a permanent shift, rather than an aberration – raises the important question of which country is truly exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Greenland Matters</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-greenland-matters-by-michael-froman-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-greenland-matters-by-michael-froman-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The announcement of a skeletal agreement between US President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was good news, even if it turns out to be a fig leaf for a failed land grab.
