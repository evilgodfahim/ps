Just as Brexit ultimately strengthened support for the European Union, MAGA-era America may serve as a cautionary example, weakening the appeal of authoritarianism in other democracies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:26:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Financial Gulf Stream Is Nearing a Tipping Point</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/financial-arrangement-that-powered-global-growth-is-unraveling-by-giancarlo-corsetti-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/financial-arrangement-that-powered-global-growth-is-unraveling-by-giancarlo-corsetti-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, the global economy rested on a financial arrangement that allowed the United States to borrow cheaply and absorb much of the world’s surplus output.

But it will take time for the country’s foreign-policy establishment to move away from “strategic autonomy” as a guiding principle, and recent US behavior has confirmed skeptics’ arguments that the West is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:16:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New World Order or Bust</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-old-order-already-broken-build-new-one-starting-with-ai-by-margrethe-vestager-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-old-order-already-broken-build-new-one-starting-with-ai-by-margrethe-vestager-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump gleefully destroying what remains of the old postwar international order, the world is a mess.
