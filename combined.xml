But when deciding whether to invest, foreigners will scrutinize the quality of the exchange's corporate-governance regulations, which will likely need to be fine-tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:36:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rogue America Is Changing the Global Economic Outlook</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/rogue-america-is-changing-the-global-economic-outlook</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/rogue-america-is-changing-the-global-economic-outlook</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the year began, US President Donald Trump has ramped up his aggression in the Western Hemisphere, including military intervention in Venezuela and threats to impose large sanctions on European Union countries that oppose US annexation of Greenland.
