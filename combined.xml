Donald Trump’s rejection of this basic truth – reflected in his dealings with Russia – augurs an age of volatility from which China will emerge a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:24:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Eve of Destruction</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/world-must-stand-up-to-trumps-wrecking-ball-munich-security-conference-by-tobias-bunde-and-sophie-eisentraut-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/world-must-stand-up-to-trumps-wrecking-ball-munich-security-conference-by-tobias-bunde-and-sophie-eisentraut-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In all the countries surveyed for the Munich Security Index 2026, the downsides of US President Donald Trump’s wrecking-ball politics dominate public perceptions.
