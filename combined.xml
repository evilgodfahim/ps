As a handful of private companies in Shenzhen and Silicon Valley race to entrench their AI dominance, similarly bold cooperation among middle powers has become imperative.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 14:17:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The New “China Shock” Is Hitting Poor Countries the Hardest</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-manufacturing-surplus-costs-for-low-middle-income-countries-by-shoumitro-chatterjee-1-and-arvind-subramanian-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-manufacturing-surplus-costs-for-low-middle-income-countries-by-shoumitro-chatterjee-1-and-arvind-subramanian-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;China’s continued dominance in low-skill export sectors reflects not just efficiency, but deliberate policy choices that prevent poorer countries from climbing the development ladder.

With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:33:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Democracy and the Case for Protecting Livelihoods</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ai-job-losses-call-for-livelihood-restoration-policy-by-mordecai-kurz-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ai-job-losses-call-for-livelihood-restoration-policy-by-mordecai-kurz-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a democratic society, those who suffer permanent job losses because of public policy will naturally consider their plight unjust, and may eventually form an electorally disruptive critical mass. Even if one does not see a strictly economic reason to redress their grievances, there most certainly is a political one.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 09:12:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Putin Is Out of Options</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-no-path-to-victory-in-ukraine-by-carl-bildt-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-no-path-to-victory-in-ukraine-by-carl-bildt-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is now clear that Russia’s army cannot get the job done in Ukraine, and that Donald Trump cannot force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into submission as long as European financial support for his government holds.

But that would not address the larger problem of America’s high health-care costs – to say nothing of its fiscal imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:55:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Electricity Will Decide the AI Race</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By advancing open AI models and investing in renewable-energy capacity, China is creating an energy-compute flywheel: more clean power enables more compute, which in turn optimizes the grid.

Worse, by compromising the confidentiality and privacy provided by end-to-end encryption, the EU's approach creates new vulnerabilities that could put users everywhere at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:20:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What Really Works Against Youth Crime?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/harsh-sentences-for-young-people-do-not-deter-crime-but-predictable-punishments-do-by-jennifer-doleac-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/harsh-sentences-for-young-people-do-not-deter-crime-but-predictable-punishments-do-by-jennifer-doleac-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that, when it comes to deterring crime, the severity of punishment – the length of a prison sentence – matters far less than whether punishment is swift and certain.
