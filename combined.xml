To address this issue, the G20 must maintain the momentum of South Africa’s presidency and push for a much-needed overhaul of international trade and finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 09:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will the AI Boom Continue?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/will-the-ai-boom-continue</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/will-the-ai-boom-continue</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Amid growing concerns about an AI bubble, Nvidia’s stellar third-quarter earnings report has reinvigorated faith in the industry and the opportunities the technology represents.
