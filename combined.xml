But for Africa, geothermal energy may well be the key to more secure, sustainable, and affordable supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:02:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump Is Taking Aim at the Midterms</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-ice-presence-for-midterm-elections-by-richard-k-sherwin-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-ice-presence-for-midterm-elections-by-richard-k-sherwin-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Given Donald Trump and his advisers' increasingly extreme rhetoric and contempt for the US Constitution, the president’s rising disapproval rating is cold comfort. The fact that he is doubling down on unpopular policies only adds to the evidence that he does not intend to allow a free and fair congressional election in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:55:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will Stablecoins Preserve Dollar Dominance?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-stablecoins-save-dollar-global-primacy-by-barry-eichengreen-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-stablecoins-save-dollar-global-primacy-by-barry-eichengreen-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The dollar may be the dominant global currency for the moment, but there are real questions about how long this moment will last. The argument that dollar-pegged stablecoins will extend it rests on a slew of shaky assumptions and leaves key questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:56:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will AI Pay Off the West’s Debts?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-will-not-rescue-rich-countries-from-debt-pressures-by-kenneth-rogoff-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-will-not-rescue-rich-countries-from-debt-pressures-by-kenneth-rogoff-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Even if AI solves the problem of rich countries’ anemic economic growth, it will almost certainly lead to a much higher share of capital in output, and a correspondingly lower share for labor. Therefore, these countries would be reckless to assume that they can rely on the technology to increase tax revenues and wipe out their debts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 11:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Overcoming Latin America’s Mounting Debt Crises</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/latin-america-debt-climate-crises-demand-systemic-global-financial-reform-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/latin-america-debt-climate-crises-demand-systemic-global-financial-reform-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Climate finance and green investments will achieve little in debt-strapped economies unless such measures are tied to systemic reform.

With an increasingly Trump-aligned media, the US Congress, and the US Supreme Court actively supporting and even facilitating his lawless behavior, resistance is becoming more urgent – and more difficult – by the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 19:09:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-s-misrule-of-law-doc-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-s-misrule-of-law-doc-2025-10</guid><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 19:08:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Case for IMF Gold Sales</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/imf-should-sell-gold-at-high-price-to-support-developing-countries-by-tim-hirschel-burns-and-marina-zucker-marques-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/imf-should-sell-gold-at-high-price-to-support-developing-countries-by-tim-hirschel-burns-and-marina-zucker-marques-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a more cost-effective solution to foreign-aid cuts than the International Monetary Fund selling a small share of its vast gold reserves, worth over $350 billion.
