But the murder by federal officers of two white US citizens at close range changes that, and the public backlash won’t fade soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:07:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>America’s Mad Emperor</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/only-mental-derangment-explains-trump-behavior-by-jeffrey-frankel-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/only-mental-derangment-explains-trump-behavior-by-jeffrey-frankel-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every "logical" explanation that has been applied to US President Donald Trump's unhinged behavior over the years has proven inadequate. At this point, detractors and former supporters alike are recognizing that Trump's words and deeds can be explained by only one thing: mental derangement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:51:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Penicillin and American Power</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/innovation-ecosystem-real-reason-for-american-technological-leadership-by-paolo-surico-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/innovation-ecosystem-real-reason-for-american-technological-leadership-by-paolo-surico-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Technological leadership is often framed as a matter of singular breakthroughs rather than institutional capacity.
