But German Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s comments about possibly revising the EU Emission Trading Scheme could be more damaging, because Europe’s carbon-pricing framework is finally inducing other countries to act.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 13:23:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A European Solution for Germany’s China Challenge</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/merz-visit-to-china-must-demonstrate-european-unity-by-daniela-schwarzer-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/merz-visit-to-china-must-demonstrate-european-unity-by-daniela-schwarzer-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's upcoming visit to China comes at a pivotal moment. China's export prowess is driving a national debate about lagging competitiveness, and that debate is taking place alongside the European Union's efforts to devise a unified China strategy at a time when the United States appears increasingly unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 12:13:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Debt Restructuring Is Senegal’s Best Bet</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/senegal-should-pursue-debt-restructuring-as-soon-as-possible-by-abdoulaye-ndiaye-and-martin-kessler-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/senegal-should-pursue-debt-restructuring-as-soon-as-possible-by-abdoulaye-ndiaye-and-martin-kessler-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Senegal does not have any pain-free options for escaping its intensifying debt crisis.

But the truth is that Europe’s social-market model and commitment to openness continue to pay dividends. Far from doubting itself, the EU should double down on its strengths and, as the US-China geopolitical rivalry heats up, tout them as an example for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:43:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/maga-s-fear-and-loathing-of-europe-doc-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/maga-s-fear-and-loathing-of-europe-doc-2026-02</guid><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 11:42:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuelan Democracy Needs Action, Not Cheap Talk</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-venezuela-plan-wrongly-puts-oil-before-democracy-by-ricardo-hausmann-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-venezuela-plan-wrongly-puts-oil-before-democracy-by-ricardo-hausmann-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s Venezuela strategy prioritizes oil reconstruction over elections, treating democracy as an afterthought.
