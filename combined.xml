Under these conditions, it is not surprising that larger powers would seek to shape their immediate surroundings – not only out of ambition, but also because they face constraints farther afield.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:35:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will Capping Credit-Card Interest Rates Help Ordinary Americans?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-trump-cap-on-credit-card-interest-rates-benefit-americans-by-jeffrey-frankel-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-trump-cap-on-credit-card-interest-rates-benefit-americans-by-jeffrey-frankel-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The federal cap on credit-card interest rates that US President Donald Trump has proposed would, in theory, prevent issuers from gouging customers. But not everyone agrees that this would be good for Americans, especially lower-income households that are often the most desperate for credit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:07:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Those Who Most Need to Understand AI Don’t Get It</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economists-academics-policymakers-not-appreciating-ai-risks-and-benefits-by-charles-ferguson-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economists-academics-policymakers-not-appreciating-ai-risks-and-benefits-by-charles-ferguson-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While anyone familiar with past technological hype cycles can see that today’s predominantly young technologists are overly optimistic about AI’s potential benefits, mainstream economists seem to suffer from tunnel vision of a different sort.
