But rationalizing spending on the National Health Service, pensions, and welfare benefits will require considerably more courage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:47:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe’s Electric Straitjacket</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-excessive-focus-on-electrification-undermining-innovation-and-resilience-by-ana-palacio-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-excessive-focus-on-electrification-undermining-innovation-and-resilience-by-ana-palacio-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reaching climate neutrality by 2050 is non-negotiable, but it is impossible to know in 2025 the best way to get there. Rather than attempt to dictate the pathway now, EU policymakers must design a strategy that leaves space for unexpected innovations and adequately accounts for geopolitical risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:30:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Pardon Racket</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/trump-corruption-of-pardon-power-by-stephen-holmes-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/trump-corruption-of-pardon-power-by-stephen-holmes-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The pardon power is the only authority the US Constitution places entirely in the president’s hands, immune from legislative override or judicial review.
