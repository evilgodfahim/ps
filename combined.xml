The international community must provide the Nigerian government with immediate surveillance support to secure the release of the abducted students, as well as long-term resources to help make the country’s schools safer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:04:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Tariffs Are Hitting India Hard</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-must-seek-tariff-carve-outs-while-pursuing-trade-diversification-and-economic-upgrading-by-shashi-tharoor-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/india-must-seek-tariff-carve-outs-while-pursuing-trade-diversification-and-economic-upgrading-by-shashi-tharoor-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs have laid bare the fragility of India’s export model, which depends on a handful of markets and a narrow band of relatively low-value-added products. Only by embracing a new model – which emphasizes diversification, regional cooperation, and value addition – can India build long-term resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Future of China’s “Electro-State”</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-must-overcome-challenges-to-complete-its-economic-transformation-by-ludovic-subran-1-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-must-overcome-challenges-to-complete-its-economic-transformation-by-ludovic-subran-1-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;China has built the machinery of an innovative, low-carbon industrial economy capable of leading the global net-zero transition and the unfolding AI revolution.
