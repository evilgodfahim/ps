To counter exclusionary nationalism, liberals must craft a unifying creed that restores a sense of shared destiny.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:13:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Progressives Can Win on Immigration</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-center-left-can-win-on-immigration-by-mark-leonard-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-center-left-can-win-on-immigration-by-mark-leonard-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For rudderless center-left parties, the debate around asylum and immigration should be seen not as a necessary evil, but as a political opportunity. By anchoring tougher enforcement in an authentic social-democratic agenda, the left can show that it has better solutions than the far right.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 16:21:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Let a Thousand AI Regimes Bloom</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-regulation-us-decentralized-governance-many-benefits-over-chinese-centralized-system-by-angela-huyue-zhang-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-regulation-us-decentralized-governance-many-benefits-over-chinese-centralized-system-by-angela-huyue-zhang-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While critics of decentralized technology regulation warn of higher compliance costs for businesses, Chinese-style centralization is hardly preferable.
