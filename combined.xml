But this is probably where the country is headed, though it may take a severe fiscal crisis to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:01:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Defending Press Freedom in the Age of Trump</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/key-to-saving-journalism-from-ai-misinformation-and-propaganda-by-martin-baron-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/key-to-saving-journalism-from-ai-misinformation-and-propaganda-by-martin-baron-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As authoritarian leaders seek to delegitimize independent news and AI blurs the line between facts and falsehoods, journalists around the world are fighting to be heard above a rising tide of misinformation and propaganda.
