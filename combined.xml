But much about his first year back in office more closely resembles the aftermath of coups.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 09:47:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Peace in Ukraine Remains a Distant Prospect</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-ukraine-russia-peace-remains-a-distant-prospect-by-ian-bremmer-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-ukraine-russia-peace-remains-a-distant-prospect-by-ian-bremmer-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When two warring parties’ core objectives are fundamentally incompatible, no amount of external pressure or diplomacy can bridge the gap between them. Peace in Ukraine will come eventually, but it almost certainly will not come from US President Donald Trump's current diplomatic push, no matter how many deadlines he sets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:42:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Eurasia’s Great Water Gamble</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/plan-to-redirect-part-siberian-freshwater-to-central-asia-strategic-necessity-by-djoomart-otorbaev-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/plan-to-redirect-part-siberian-freshwater-to-central-asia-strategic-necessity-by-djoomart-otorbaev-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is rapidly melting the glaciers that feed Central Asia’s rivers, pushing the region toward an ecological tipping point.
