Russia’s war against Ukraine, for example, strengthened the domestic positions of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ahead of pivotal elections.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 09:42:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Trump Could Win Over the Developing World</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-trump-administration-should-push-for-imf-sdr-not-swap-lines-by-vera-songwe-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-trump-administration-should-push-for-imf-sdr-not-swap-lines-by-vera-songwe-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At a time when developing countries are under fiscal pressure and struggling to invest in future growth, the United States could come to the rescue – and without putting one cent of its own money on the line.
