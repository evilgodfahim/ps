To move beyond the current system of competitive authoritarianism to full-blown fascism, he must give the country a war that it does not want, and then win – but that is out of his reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Supreme Court’s Tariff Ruling Changes Little</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-changes-little-for-other-countries-by-shang-jin-wei-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-changes-little-for-other-countries-by-shang-jin-wei-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The US Supreme Court’s ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs may modify the legal facade of US trade policy, as well as produce a brief surge of imports into the United States. But, ultimately, it is unlikely to reduce the overall height or significantly alter the country composition of US trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 16:44:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Stablecoins Are Raising New Risks for Emerging Markets</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stablecoin-adoption-poses-threat-to-emerging-economies-by-eduardo-l-yeyati-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stablecoin-adoption-poses-threat-to-emerging-economies-by-eduardo-l-yeyati-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are rapidly evolving from payment instruments into full-fledged financial infrastructure in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, introducing risks that the US-centric debate has largely overlooked.
