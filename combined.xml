But this could cause an exodus from the profession, undermining the disease-surveillance system and putting American lives at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:07:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Big, Not-So-Beautiful Economic Mess</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-first-year-back-leaves-his-economic-agenda-in-trouble-by-anne-o-krueger-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-first-year-back-leaves-his-economic-agenda-in-trouble-by-anne-o-krueger-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite US President Donald Trump’s promises to lower inflation, shrink deficits, and revive manufacturing, his tariff wars have imposed steep costs on key allies, triggered price spikes, and hurt American producers and farmers.

In fact, the holiday has been corrupted by non-human entities: a set of algorithms that we flatteringly call artificial intelligence has desecrated the season’s music and holiday ritual.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:02:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>PS Commentators’ Best Reads in 2025</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ps-commentators-best-reads-2025-by-ps-editors-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ps-commentators-best-reads-2025-by-ps-editors-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As technological advances and geopolitical turmoil transform our economies, this year’s recommended books challenge prevailing assumptions and prompt us to reconsider what we take for granted.

But even as America rejects everything it once stood for, Europeans' only choice is to double down on their own principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 18:49:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Brazil’s Bold Industrial Turn</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brazil-lula-reindustrialization-gamble-by-jayati-ghosh-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brazil-lula-reindustrialization-gamble-by-jayati-ghosh-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite strong opposition in Congress, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has launched an ambitious industrial policy aimed at boosting renewable-energy capacity and expanding domestic defense capabilities.

And because this will require breaking up the European Union, the decades-long transatlantic alliance has given way to enmity in remarkably short order.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 16:15:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Decision Time for Europe</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-must-plan-for-ukraine-postwar-scenario-on-its-own-by-mark-leonard-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-must-plan-for-ukraine-postwar-scenario-on-its-own-by-mark-leonard-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Given the Trump administration’s recent statements and policy pronouncements, European leaders no longer have any excuse for failing to map out their own long-term security strategy.
