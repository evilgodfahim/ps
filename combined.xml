If past is prologue, there can be little doubt that it will end badly.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 11:21:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Destruction of Maritime Law Raises the Risk of War</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-deep-sea-mining-destroying-marine-law-risks-war-by-guy-standing-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-deep-sea-mining-destroying-marine-law-risks-war-by-guy-standing-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Unless rescinded, Donald Trump’s executive order greenlighting deep-sea mining in direct violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea will almost certainly unleash a lawless gold rush among major powers. Beyond the clear environmental risks, the scope for armed conflict is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:41:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How the G20 Could Help Eliminate Global Hunger</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/south-africa-must-use-g20-presidency-to-promote-fight-against-hunger-by-raj-patel-and-refiloe-joala-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/south-africa-must-use-g20-presidency-to-promote-fight-against-hunger-by-raj-patel-and-refiloe-joala-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The G20 has long vowed to confront the global hunger crisis, but has struggled to translate its pledges into tangible results.

The fact that he is doubling down on unpopular policies only adds to the evidence that he does not intend to allow a free and fair congressional election in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:55:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will Stablecoins Preserve Dollar Dominance?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-stablecoins-save-dollar-global-primacy-by-barry-eichengreen-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-stablecoins-save-dollar-global-primacy-by-barry-eichengreen-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The dollar may be the dominant global currency for the moment, but there are real questions about how long this moment will last. The argument that dollar-pegged stablecoins will extend it rests on a slew of shaky assumptions and leaves key questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:56:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will AI Pay Off the West’s Debts?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-will-not-rescue-rich-countries-from-debt-pressures-by-kenneth-rogoff-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-will-not-rescue-rich-countries-from-debt-pressures-by-kenneth-rogoff-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Even if AI solves the problem of rich countries’ anemic economic growth, it will almost certainly lead to a much higher share of capital in output, and a correspondingly lower share for labor. Therefore, these countries would be reckless to assume that they can rely on the technology to increase tax revenues and wipe out their debts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 11:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Overcoming Latin America’s Mounting Debt Crises</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/latin-america-debt-climate-crises-demand-systemic-global-financial-reform-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/latin-america-debt-climate-crises-demand-systemic-global-financial-reform-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Climate finance and green investments will achieve little in debt-strapped economies unless such measures are tied to systemic reform.
