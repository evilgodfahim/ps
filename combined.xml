The continent’s governments must seize this opportunity to develop higher-value-added sectors that can simultaneously strengthen climate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 19:00:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe’s Critical Raw Materials Strategy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-critical-raw-materials-rare-earths-strategy-by-nicola-beer-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-critical-raw-materials-rare-earths-strategy-by-nicola-beer-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With China dominating the global supply of rare-earth magnets and other critical materials, Europe is dangerously vulnerable to shortages and potential export controls.

But this “peace” plan, if implemented, would encourage Russia to continue waging war in Europe, undermine the international order, and increase the risk of nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:01:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How MAGA Hopes to Pervert Transatlanticism</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/maga-trump-perverting-the-transatlantic-relationship-by-joschka-fischer-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/maga-trump-perverting-the-transatlantic-relationship-by-joschka-fischer-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Under US President Donald Trump's second administration, transatlanticism is being transformed from an internationalist project into a nationalist one. Not only is Trump's MAGA movement unapologetically nationalist, but it is eager to make common cause with Europeans who share its chauvinist view of politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 15:29:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Ukraine Deserves to Survive</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-corruption-investigation-exposes-putins-worst-fear-by-anna-husarska-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-corruption-investigation-exposes-putins-worst-fear-by-anna-husarska-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With a new US-Russia peace plan proposing what amounts to Ukraine's capitulation to its aggressor, a corruption investigation focusing on President Volodymyr Zelensky's inner circle would seem to be the last thing the country needs.
