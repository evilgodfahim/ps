But to ensure a swift and effective rollout, West African countries must start planning now to determine who should receive it, how to deliver it, and how to finance and regulate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:46:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Elon Musk’s $1.25 Trillion Mirage</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/musk-spacex-xai-merger-produced-predictably-specious-valuation-by-yanis-varoufakis-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/musk-spacex-xai-merger-produced-predictably-specious-valuation-by-yanis-varoufakis-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;More often than not, share prices are rigged, which is why they are a dreadful predictor of profitability even on average, and why they have become the primary instrument for transferring wealth upwards.

These changes could impede regulators’ ability to identify emerging risks at a time when the US financial system faces hidden losses and structural weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 12:05:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mexico’s Grim Development Prospects</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/mexico-amlo-scheinbaum-diminished-economic-prospects-by-santiago-levy-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/mexico-amlo-scheinbaum-diminished-economic-prospects-by-santiago-levy-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mexico's low and falling growth is not the result of macroeconomic instability, a lack of investment, insufficient labor, or poor export performance.
