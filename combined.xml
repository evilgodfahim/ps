Reducing dependence on China is not as simple as switching a few suppliers; it demands the cultivation of comparable industrial density, including supplier networks, skills, tooling, and patient finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:43:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Trade Truce Won’t Restore the US-India Relationship</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trade-truce-will-not-restore-us-india-relationship-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trade-truce-will-not-restore-us-india-relationship-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of an interim trade deal between the US and India, hopes are high that the bruising confrontation initiated by President Donald Trump last year is coming to an end. But while the deal may ease tensions, trust – the essential currency of any strategic partnership – is unlikely to be restored any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:47:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The World Needs Europe to Get Its Act Together – Fast</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/world-needs-europe-as-alternative-model-to-us-and-china-by-dani-rodrik-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/world-needs-europe-as-alternative-model-to-us-and-china-by-dani-rodrik-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If Europe is to assert itself on the global stage, as it should, it needs to restore its self-confidence.
