Unless it makes rapid strides toward building the physical and financial infrastructure that a domestic European AI industry will need, such preoccupations will prove to be more of a liability than an asset.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:41:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Super Bowl of Prediction Markets</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/prediction-markets-market-design-to-unlock-full-potential-by-scott-duke-kominers-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/prediction-markets-market-design-to-unlock-full-potential-by-scott-duke-kominers-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As prediction markets have exploded onto the scene in recent years, allowing bets to be placed on a wide range of event-driven outcomes, many have asked whether it is optimal to have markets in everything.

But it will take time for the country’s foreign-policy establishment to move away from “strategic autonomy” as a guiding principle, and recent US behavior has confirmed skeptics’ arguments that the West is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:16:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New World Order or Bust</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-old-order-already-broken-build-new-one-starting-with-ai-by-margrethe-vestager-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-old-order-already-broken-build-new-one-starting-with-ai-by-margrethe-vestager-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump gleefully destroying what remains of the old postwar international order, the world is a mess.
