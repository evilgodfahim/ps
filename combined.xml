After all, most have benefited from favorable external conditions, and they are still on a slower growth path than before the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:30:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Path to Universal Prosperity by 2100</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/realistic-growth-plan-for-universal-prosperity-by-next-century-by-marc-canal-noguer-et-al-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/realistic-growth-plan-for-universal-prosperity-by-next-century-by-marc-canal-noguer-et-al-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past century, economic growth has delivered higher incomes and longer lives, while empowering millions of people. Looking to the future, a world where everyone can live securely and with options – as opposed to just subsisting – is within reach, but will require emerging economies to continue expanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 17:44:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Kevin Warsh’s Dangerous Monetary Nostalgia</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/kevin-warsh-plan-to-shrink-fed-balance-sheet-is-misguided-by-lucrezia-reichlin-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/kevin-warsh-plan-to-shrink-fed-balance-sheet-is-misguided-by-lucrezia-reichlin-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The next US Federal Reserve chair seems to think that the large size of the central bank’s balance sheet reflects a discretionary policy choice which can and should be reversed. In reality, however, the Fed's balance sheet has become part of the financial system’s core infrastructure, and shrinking it would carry serious risks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:22:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe Should Reject US-Style Competitiveness</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-should-not-emulate-us-style-competitiveness-by-sandeep-vaheesan-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-should-not-emulate-us-style-competitiveness-by-sandeep-vaheesan-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;European leaders seem increasingly convinced that, to succeed in the 21st century, they must reshape Europe's economy in America’s image. But the American brand of "competitiveness" contributes to major imbalances and far-reaching harm, which the European Union can avoid by embracing effective competition policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:51:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will Democracy Govern Capitalism - or Be Consumed by It?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-corporate-tax-convention-democracy-vs-trumpian-caesarism-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-and-jayati-ghosh-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-corporate-tax-convention-democracy-vs-trumpian-caesarism-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-and-jayati-ghosh-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Following aggressive lobbying by the Trump administration, more than 145 countries agreed to give big US multinationals a free pass under the global corporate minimum tax rules that were agreed in 2021.
