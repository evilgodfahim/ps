The events in Minneapolis underscore the dangers of unchecked executive power, as weakened courts and a compliant Congress leave states exposed to federal coercion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:24:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s American Titanic</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trumps-america-a-sinking-ship-rest-of-world-seeking-dry-land-by-harold-james-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trumps-america-a-sinking-ship-rest-of-world-seeking-dry-land-by-harold-james-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s bullying of allies and fallacious arguments have put the US on a collision course with disaster, winning only rare plaudits, notably from the likes of Vladimir Putin. The rest of the world is reorienting itself away from the United States, making an orderly dash for the life rafts that will carry them to dry land together.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:54:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Promise of a Middle-Power Alliance</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-middle-powers-can-realize-mark-carney-alliance-vision-by-moreno-bertoldi-and-marco-buti-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-middle-powers-can-realize-mark-carney-alliance-vision-by-moreno-bertoldi-and-marco-buti-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In his landmark Davos speech, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged the world’s middle powers to band together, or else risk being dominated by the United States and China.
