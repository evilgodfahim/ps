From the likelihood that President Donald Trump’s tariff chickens will come home to roost to the risk of a stock-market crash, there is good reason to fear that the global economy’s most powerful engine may stall.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:25:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/where-is-the-us-economy-headed-in-2026-doc-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/where-is-the-us-economy-headed-in-2026-doc-2026-01</guid><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:25:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Case for European Nationalism</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-needs-more-integration-not-less-by-ricardo-hausmann-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-needs-more-integration-not-less-by-ricardo-hausmann-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite US President Donald Trump’s claims to the contrary, Europe’s problem is not too much integration but too little.
