National development banks, sovereign wealth funds, debt swaps, and public-private partnerships can foster sustainable investment and help reduce energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 15:13:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Vulnerable Is China?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-vulnerable-is-china</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-vulnerable-is-china</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:08:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-vulnerable-is-china-doc-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-vulnerable-is-china-doc-2025-10</guid><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:07:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Pivot from Asia</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-pivot-from-asia-to-western-hemisphere-by-richard-haass-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-pivot-from-asia-to-western-hemisphere-by-richard-haass-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After US President Donald Trump's trip to the region, one could be forgiven for concluding that the "pivot to Asia" begun when Barack Obama was in the White House has been replaced by a pivot to the Western Hemisphere. Needless to say, this is not the pivot America’s friends and allies in Asia were and are counting on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:02:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can China Catch Up with the US Economically?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-will-avoid-the-middle-income-trap-but-fail-to-outgrow-the-us-economy-by-keun-lee-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-will-avoid-the-middle-income-trap-but-fail-to-outgrow-the-us-economy-by-keun-lee-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With its GNI per capita having increased steadily in recent years, China has probably evaded the middle-income trap.
