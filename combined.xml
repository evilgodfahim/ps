But AI has made human time functionally abundant, undermining that foundation and fracturing labor into three incompatible regimes no single legal system can reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 09:56:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The New Age of Resource Competition Needs Transparency</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-resource-competition-demands-transparency-democratic-accountability-by-helen-clark-and-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-resource-competition-demands-transparency-democratic-accountability-by-helen-clark-and-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As countries scramble to secure the minerals needed for clean energy, digital technologies, AI, and defense industries, the new era of resource competition implies both great promise and grave peril.

To move beyond the current system of competitive authoritarianism to full-blown fascism, he must give the country a war that it does not want, and then win – but that is out of his reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Supreme Court’s Tariff Ruling Changes Little</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-changes-little-for-other-countries-by-shang-jin-wei-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-changes-little-for-other-countries-by-shang-jin-wei-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The US Supreme Court’s ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs may modify the legal facade of US trade policy, as well as produce a brief surge of imports into the United States.
