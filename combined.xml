But the daily dose of allegations, accusations, and scurrilous gossip risks triggering a moral panic that could intensify calls for strongman rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 12:22:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What Will the Fed’s “Warsh Era” Bring?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/warsh-leadership-will-be-measured-by-reform-not-interest-rates-by-mohamed-a-el-erian-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/warsh-leadership-will-be-measured-by-reform-not-interest-rates-by-mohamed-a-el-erian-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The next Federal Reserve chair will inherit an institution that, by any historical measure, is deeply fractured internally and lacks credibility externally.

To move beyond the current system of competitive authoritarianism to full-blown fascism, he must give the country a war that it does not want, and then win – but that is out of his reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:46:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Supreme Court’s Tariff Ruling Changes Little</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-changes-little-for-other-countries-by-shang-jin-wei-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/supreme-court-trump-tariff-ruling-changes-little-for-other-countries-by-shang-jin-wei-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The US Supreme Court’s ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs may modify the legal facade of US trade policy, as well as produce a brief surge of imports into the United States.

But that narrative depends on ignorance of Somali integration and of America’s own role in Somalia’s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 16:53:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The High Price of Political Paranoia</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-trump-xi-paranoia-undermines-their-countries-interests-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-trump-xi-paranoia-undermines-their-countries-interests-by-nina-l-khrushcheva-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The more centralized a political system is, the more likely it is that national interests and goals will take a backseat to the leader’s personal whims, desires, and insecurities.
