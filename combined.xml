In fact, by appointing incompetent subordinates who owe him everything, Trump recalls a tried-and-tested Stalinist practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:32:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Basel Consensus Is Cracking</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/illusion-of-regulatory-unity-is-unraveling-by-howard-davies-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/illusion-of-regulatory-unity-is-unraveling-by-howard-davies-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Behind the facade of unity, global banking supervisors are split between fear of over-regulation and concern that easing rules invites a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis.
