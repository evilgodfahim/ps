Whereas fascists and imperialists know that war requires real combat, Trump seems unwilling or unable to go that far, not least because he is weak at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:18:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Special Military Operation in Venezuela</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/trump-venezuela-invasion-defeats-us-constitution-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/trump-venezuela-invasion-defeats-us-constitution-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The framers of the US Constitution designed a system to compel the executive to explain its actions, wagering that requiring justifications would discipline power and prevent its arbitrary exercise.

No country that hosts a major Trump-branded property or strikes a high-profile business deal with a member of Trump’s inner circle – including some with well-documented ties to global terrorism – faces US travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:40:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Case for Universalism in a Fragmenting World</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/case-for-internationalism-at-a-time-of-nationalist-resurgence-by-kaushik-basu-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/case-for-internationalism-at-a-time-of-nationalist-resurgence-by-kaushik-basu-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The current wave of hyper-nationalism reflects growing anxiety over a deeply interconnected global economy that no longer fits neatly within political borders.
