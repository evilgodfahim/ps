That is a worthy goal, but “abundance” is probably not the clearest way to convey it, let alone the most effective means of achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:27:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Social Protection Can Accelerate Climate Action</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cop30-should-integrate-climate-goals-into-inclusive-social-protection-systems-by-tracy-kajumba-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cop30-should-integrate-climate-goals-into-inclusive-social-protection-systems-by-tracy-kajumba-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A new report shows that the integration of climate objectives and social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering finance where it is needed most.
