By relying on tariffs and subsidies, the United States is now paying the price for underestimating how tightly its economy is bound to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:37:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Product Scorecards Can Help Rescue Europe’s Green Deal</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/a-product-level-approach-to-sustainability-reporting-can-save-the-eu-green-deal-by-brian-hill-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/a-product-level-approach-to-sustainability-reporting-can-save-the-eu-green-deal-by-brian-hill-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While Europe’s competitiveness concerns are understandable, inaction on social and environmental challenges also carries high economic costs. Rather than resign itself to stifling its nascent sustainability-disclosure regime under pressure from the US, the EU should devise a new system based on products, not industries.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:01:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What Does the Market Really Think About AI?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-economic-potential-what-markets-are-really-saying-by-isaiah-andrews-and-maryam-farboodi-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-economic-potential-what-markets-are-really-saying-by-isaiah-andrews-and-maryam-farboodi-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite all the enthusiasm for AI, which has undoubtedly demonstrated impressive capabilities, the signal from bond markets suggests that investors are unconvinced that the technology will generate sustained or widespread growth, let alone a more extreme positive or negative outcome.
