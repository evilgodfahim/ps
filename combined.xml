The only way out for Japan is to boost economic growth; but for the US, it is to raise taxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Best Treatment for the Most Painful Medical Condition Is Illegal</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/psychedelic-drugs-should-be-legal-for-cluster-headache-by-peter-singer-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/psychedelic-drugs-should-be-legal-for-cluster-headache-by-peter-singer-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of cluster headaches, also known as "suicide headaches," will do anything to stop what is possibly the most painful condition known to medicine, including using illegal drugs like psilocybin and LSD.
