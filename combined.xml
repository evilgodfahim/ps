Without interventions that highlight the benefits of international engagement, broad-based cooperation will remain a hard sell.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:16:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Quantum Computing Could Fix AI’s Sustainability Problem</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/quantum-computing-solution-to-ai-insatiable-energy-appetite-by-bertrand-badre-et-al-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/quantum-computing-solution-to-ai-insatiable-energy-appetite-by-bertrand-badre-et-al-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As generative AI pushes power grids to their limits, the industry largely favors incremental measures that fail to address underlying issues.

But it is a superpower nonetheless, and it is increasingly pursuing investments and reforms that will make it not only unassailable but also widely attractive in a dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:02:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The EU Cannot Afford to Bluff on Ukrainian Membership</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-cannot-bluff-on-ukrainian-membership-process-by-laszlo-bruszt-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-cannot-bluff-on-ukrainian-membership-process-by-laszlo-bruszt-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Europe’s debate over the process of making Ukraine a full member is often framed as a test of resolve; but credibility is based as much on capacity as on intent.

The absence of reliable statistics, lagging innovation, and worsening air quality all point to institutional decay that only sustained, coordinated national action can reverse.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:07:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Financing the Global South’s Infrastructure Boom</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/financing-global-south-infrastructure-boom-by-rakesh-mohan-and-divya-srinivasan-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/financing-global-south-infrastructure-boom-by-rakesh-mohan-and-divya-srinivasan-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across the Global South, one of the biggest challenges is not just to build more infrastructure, but to build it right.
