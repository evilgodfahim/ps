In reality, AI erodes academic freedom, weakens critical reading, and subordinates the pursuit of knowledge to corporate interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 14:21:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can Humanity Fix What It Has Broken?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/climate-change-poverty-reduction-demand-attention-not-fatalism-by-juan-manuel-santos-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/climate-change-poverty-reduction-demand-attention-not-fatalism-by-juan-manuel-santos-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As climate-driven disasters intensify, the costs are falling hardest on the poor, underscoring the urgent need for a just transition to clean energy and a net-zero-emissions economy.

With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:33:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Democracy and the Case for Protecting Livelihoods</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ai-job-losses-call-for-livelihood-restoration-policy-by-mordecai-kurz-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ai-job-losses-call-for-livelihood-restoration-policy-by-mordecai-kurz-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a democratic society, those who suffer permanent job losses because of public policy will naturally consider their plight unjust, and may eventually form an electorally disruptive critical mass. Even if one does not see a strictly economic reason to redress their grievances, there most certainly is a political one.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 09:12:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Putin Is Out of Options</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-no-path-to-victory-in-ukraine-by-carl-bildt-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/putin-no-path-to-victory-in-ukraine-by-carl-bildt-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is now clear that Russia’s army cannot get the job done in Ukraine, and that Donald Trump cannot force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into submission as long as European financial support for his government holds. Whether Russian leaders realize it or not, they have no path to victory.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 15:40:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Problem with America’s Health-Care Subsidies</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-health-care-subsidies-should-be-allowed-to-expire-by-michael-r-strain-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-health-care-subsidies-should-be-allowed-to-expire-by-michael-r-strain-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The US federal government shutdown has become a standoff over health care that will likely end with some sort of extension of the temporary health-insurance subsidies adopted during the pandemic. But that would not address the larger problem of America’s high health-care costs – to say nothing of its fiscal imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:55:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Electricity Will Decide the AI Race</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By advancing open AI models and investing in renewable-energy capacity, China is creating an energy-compute flywheel: more clean power enables more compute, which in turn optimizes the grid. This puts China at a distinct advantage vis-à-vis the West, where energy constraints are creating digital bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:41:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Harnessing AI While Supporting Democracy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-promises-and-perils-for-democracy-by-kelly-born-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-promises-and-perils-for-democracy-by-kelly-born-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From deepfakes and black-box algorithms to new tools to improve government effectiveness and civic engagement, AI is already reshaping democracies.

Worse, by compromising the confidentiality and privacy provided by end-to-end encryption, the EU's approach creates new vulnerabilities that could put users everywhere at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 16:20:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What Really Works Against Youth Crime?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/harsh-sentences-for-young-people-do-not-deter-crime-but-predictable-punishments-do-by-jennifer-doleac-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/harsh-sentences-for-young-people-do-not-deter-crime-but-predictable-punishments-do-by-jennifer-doleac-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that, when it comes to deterring crime, the severity of punishment – the length of a prison sentence – matters far less than whether punishment is swift and certain. This finding holds true for adults, but the difference is especially stark for teenagers, given their higher impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:36:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is Economics Promoting Inequality?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-focus-on-self-interest-is-fueling-inequality-and-undermining-cooperation-by-kaushik-basu-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-focus-on-self-interest-is-fueling-inequality-and-undermining-cooperation-by-kaushik-basu-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mainstream economics has often underestimated the critical role of trust and cooperation in enabling prosperity. As a result, it has justified and even encouraged the greed, exploitation, and extreme inequality that are eroding political accountability, contributing to rising nationalism, and undermining human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:00:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Manifest Destiny</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reviving-us-imperialism-and-martial-ethos-will-end-badly-by-joe-jackson-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reviving-us-imperialism-and-martial-ethos-will-end-badly-by-joe-jackson-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump appears committed to extending America's imperialist legacy and channeling a martial ethos that can be traced back to the Spanish-American War of 1898, when the US "liberated" Cuba and the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule.
