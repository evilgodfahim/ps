But neither that outcome nor the 2028 election is likely to lead to a realignment of US politics that delivers a government capable of sustaining policies long enough to address the problems the country faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:11:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why the High Seas Treaty Matters for Everyone</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/high-seas-treaty-why-it-matters-for-coastal-and-landlocked-countries-alike-by-arthur-peter-mutharika-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/high-seas-treaty-why-it-matters-for-coastal-and-landlocked-countries-alike-by-arthur-peter-mutharika-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When Malawi became the first landlocked country to ratify the High Seas Treaty, it helped redefine what ocean stewardship looks like.

Reducing dependence on China is not as simple as switching a few suppliers; it demands the cultivation of comparable industrial density, including supplier networks, skills, tooling, and patient finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:43:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Trade Truce Won’t Restore the US-India Relationship</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trade-truce-will-not-restore-us-india-relationship-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-02</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trade-truce-will-not-restore-us-india-relationship-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-02</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of an interim trade deal between the US and India, hopes are high that the bruising confrontation initiated by President Donald Trump last year is coming to an end.
