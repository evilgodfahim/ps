To assess whether all the investment pouring into the industry will build something useful, three questions must be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will China Forcibly Boost Fertility?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-births-rebound-will-be-temporary-ban-abortion-contraception-unlikely-by-yi-fuxian-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-births-rebound-will-be-temporary-ban-abortion-contraception-unlikely-by-yi-fuxian-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;China is widely expected to adopt a range of pronatalist policies in a bid to raise birth rates. But recent efforts to encourage women to have more babies will have short-lived effects, while coercive measures – such as bans on contraception and abortion – would trigger a public backlash and prove futile at best.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 16:32:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Do US Congressional Leaders Keep Beating the Stock Market?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/when-lawmakers-outperform-wall-street-by-shang-jin-wei-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/when-lawmakers-outperform-wall-street-by-shang-jin-wei-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress continue to trade individual stocks even as they shape legislative agendas and gain access to non-public information.
