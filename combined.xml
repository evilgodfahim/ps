But a closer look at the numbers confirms that, while denouncing foreigners can be politically fruitful, attempting to get rid of them is both economically costly and demonstrably futile.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 18:14:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Benin’s Failed Coup and the Future of African Democracy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benin-coup-plot-future-of-democracy-in-africa-by-kingsley-moghalu-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benin-coup-plot-future-of-democracy-in-africa-by-kingsley-moghalu-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of coups and coup plots in West Africa, most recently in Benin, suggests that the region's performative approach to Western-style democracy is running out of steam. While democracy itself is not dead, the continent most likely is heading toward more varied forms of political organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:11:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Will the EU’s Blacklisting of Russia Make a Difference?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-blacklisting-russia-money-laundering-financing-terrorism-is-effective-but-painful-by-miles-kellerman-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-blacklisting-russia-money-laundering-financing-terrorism-is-effective-but-painful-by-miles-kellerman-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has finally added Russia to its list of “high-risk” third countries with strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. This blunt measure will close certain loopholes while also imposing collateral damage on innocent Russians.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:35:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Donald Trump Is Unaffordable</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/affordability-crisis-frustrating-us-voters-ahead-of-2026-elections-by-desmond-lachman-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/affordability-crisis-frustrating-us-voters-ahead-of-2026-elections-by-desmond-lachman-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is every reason to think that US President Donald Trump will not have solved his affordability problem by the time voters head to the polls for next year's midterm elections.

The result will be bad for most Americans and their European allies, but highly beneficial for financiers, tech billionaires, racists, and authoritarian powers, especially Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 20:25:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-s-ethnonational-security-strategy-doc-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-s-ethnonational-security-strategy-doc-2025-12</guid><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 20:25:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Global Economy’s Hidden Rebalancing</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-economy-2026-growth-outlook-unchanged-but-capital-flows-are-shifting-by-marcello-estevao-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-economy-2026-growth-outlook-unchanged-but-capital-flows-are-shifting-by-marcello-estevao-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Although the global growth rate in 2026 is projected to be almost the same as it was in 2025, the headline figure belies deeper structural shifts in capital flows and comparative advantage. These shifts are the real story, because they are quietly reshaping how global savings and investment interact over the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:00:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Global AI Governance Could Work</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-ai-governance-should-follow-architectural-model-by-jayant-sinha-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-ai-governance-should-follow-architectural-model-by-jayant-sinha-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Societies differ in their views on privacy, experimentation, market openness, and safety, so no single regulatory model can ever accommodate everyone’s preferences.

The only way out for Japan is to boost economic growth; but for the US, it is to raise taxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Best Treatment for the Most Painful Medical Condition Is Illegal</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/psychedelic-drugs-should-be-legal-for-cluster-headache-by-peter-singer-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/psychedelic-drugs-should-be-legal-for-cluster-headache-by-peter-singer-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of cluster headaches, also known as "suicide headaches," will do anything to stop what is possibly the most painful condition known to medicine, including using illegal drugs like psilocybin and LSD.
