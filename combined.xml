Dismantling these monopolies in the European market, and building sovereign digital infrastructure, is not just possible, but essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:21:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Fraught Politics of Corporate Disclosures</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/anti-esg-politics-misses-the-point-material-information-by-raghuram-g-rajan-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/anti-esg-politics-misses-the-point-material-information-by-raghuram-g-rajan-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission must recognize that a wide variety of interests look at corporate financial disclosures, and that the effects of such information can be material in a variety of ways. To reject environmental, social, and governance concerns as political is itself an example of politicization.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:01:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What Chinese Leaders Really Think of Trump</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/chinese-view-of-trump-world-disorder-by-mark-leonard-2025-11</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/chinese-view-of-trump-world-disorder-by-mark-leonard-2025-11</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;According to Chinese academics, economists, and retired military officers, the country's leaders are not losing any sleep over Donald Trump's America First agenda.
