The answer is not to train them for specific tasks that may soon become obsolete, but to make them as adaptable and intellectually independent as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:40:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Appeasing Trump Only Invites Betrayal - as Europe’s Far Right Just Learned</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-greenland-shows-that-only-interest-is-in-domination-and-others-self-abasement-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-greenland-shows-that-only-interest-is-in-domination-and-others-self-abasement-by-stephen-holmes-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump laying claim to Greenland, Europeans have finally realized who they are dealing with. The US president is animated less by the prospect of deal-making than by the need for domination, less by the spirit of exchange than by the perverse pleasure of belittling others and exalting himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:52:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why AI Is Unlike Previous Tech Booms</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-boom-rewrites-tech-industry-playbook-by-dambisa-moyo-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-boom-rewrites-tech-industry-playbook-by-dambisa-moyo-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI follows a fundamentally different competitive logic than earlier technological revolutions.

The result is a country that retains the symbols of self-government but functions as an American protectorate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:57:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Philanthropy Must Dive Deeper to Save the Ocean</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/philanthropy-can-help-unlock-financing-necessary-to-protect-ocean-health-by-shaun-seow-2026-01</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/philanthropy-can-help-unlock-financing-necessary-to-protect-ocean-health-by-shaun-seow-2026-01</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite growing pressure on marine ecosystems, ocean-health projects often remain underdeveloped because funding, policy, and implementation fail to move in sync.
