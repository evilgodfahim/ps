Now, as research and investment finally begin to catch up, companies and investors need to recognize that meeting women’s needs is the right strategy for the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:42:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Worsening Geopolitics of Water in the Middle East</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/iran-drought-and-geopolitics-of-water-in-middle-east-by-shlomo-ben-ami-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/iran-drought-and-geopolitics-of-water-in-middle-east-by-shlomo-ben-ami-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Countries across the Middle East are facing acute water shortages, owing to poor resource management, accelerating climate change, and regional power politics. In the absence of concerted diplomacy, water will soon be another flash point in a chronically unstable region.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:26:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How the Green Transition Can Support Africa’s Development</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-growth-depends-on-more-than-renewable-energy-by-saliem-fakir-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-growth-depends-on-more-than-renewable-energy-by-saliem-fakir-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its vast renewables potential, Africa’s clean-energy transition is being impeded by deepening economic and debt pressures. Any credible climate strategy must combine coordinated debt relief with growth-oriented, low-carbon investment that strengthens resilience and advances long-term national goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:34:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Peace as an Economic Strategy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/peacemaking-as-an-economic-strategy-investing-in-conflict-prevention-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-rainer-kattel-2025-12</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/peacemaking-as-an-economic-strategy-investing-in-conflict-prevention-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-rainer-kattel-2025-12</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that wars have driven extraordinary innovation, generating everything from the radar to the internet.
